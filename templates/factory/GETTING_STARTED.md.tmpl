# Getting Started

## Route forwarding

Define dependencies and sync:

- add dependencies using `codefly add dependencies YOUR_KRAKEND_SERVICE`
- sync the service using `codefly sync YOUR_KRAKEND_SERVICE`

You will be asked what routes you want to expose.
```shell
Corresponding route on the API service will be /platform/workspace/deploy
Want to expose REST route: /deploy POST for service <workspace> from module <platform>
> Yes (authenticated)
  Yes (non authenticated)
  No (internal only)
```

You can modify route configurations easily in `routing/rest` where routes are grouped by module, service and path.

## Authentication

### JWT

In `configurations/{ENV}`, add `auth.yaml` file with the following content:
```yaml
jwt:
  audience: YOUR_AUDIENCE
  url: YOUR_BASE_URL
```
with the proper values for the environment. The URL is the base for the `.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint.

### Fake authentication and debugging

When running locally or testing, you may not want to use any real authentication endpoints so you can use this fake authentication that will inject`test-auth-id` as the user Auth ID.
```yaml
fake:
  user-auth-id: "test-auth-id"

```
